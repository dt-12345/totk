This is mostly just for the headers and to serve as a reference for reverse engineering

Unfortunately, it's not super feasible to decompile *TotK* (at least matching decompilation) so reimplementation is not a primary goal here

Feel free to open pull requests with changes and whatever else, I'm not experienced with this at all and mostly just copied the *BotW* decompilation project for the project structure

I haven't actually started working on any game/engine headers yet but soon hopefully
